<h1> The <tt>s6dns_engine</tt> library interface </h1>

<p>
 The following functions are declared in the <tt>s6-dns/s6dns-engine.h</tt> header,
and implemented in the <tt>libs6dns.a</tt> or <tt>libs6dns.so</tt> library.
</p>

<h2> General information </h2>

<p>
 <tt>s6dns_engine</tt> is the nitty-gritty of DNS query management. These
are the low-level asynchronous primitives sending DNS queries over the
network, and getting answers.
</p>

<p>
 <tt>s6dns_engine</tt> has been inspired by Dan J. Bernstein's
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dns_transmit.html">dns_transmit</a>
library, but does not borrow any code from it. Unlike
<tt>dns_transmit</tt>, <tt>s6dns_engine</tt> does not assume that
network send operations are instant successes; <tt>s6dns_engine</tt>
descriptors can be selected for writing as well as for reading.
Also, if the underlying <a href="//skarnet.org/software/skalibs">
skalibs</a> has been compiled with IPv6 support, <tt>s6dns_engine</tt>
supports native IPv6 transport.
</p>

<p>
 The <tt>s6dns_engine</tt> functions are used in the implementation of the
<tt>s6dns_resolven_loop</tt> function - which is nothing more than a
simple event loop around the <tt>s6dns_engine</tt> primitives - and the
<a href="../skadns/skadnsd.html">skadnsd</a> daemon. Both pieces of code are
good examples of how to use <tt>s6dns_engine</tt>.
</p>

<p>
 However, unless you're implementing a DNS cache, you probably should
not call the
<tt>s6dns_engine</tt> functions directly: they are very low-level. If you
need synchronous resolution, use the
<a href="s6dns-resolve.html">s6dns_resolve</a> functions. If you need
asynchronous DNS operations, use the 
<a href="../skadns/index.html">skadns</a> functions, which are
designed to provide a higher level interface to multiple asynchronous
DNS queries.
</p>

<h2> Data structures </h2>

<p>
 A <tt>s6dns_engine_t</tt> structure holds all the data necessary to
manage a DNS query (and response). It must be initialized to S6DNS_ENGINE_ZERO
when first declared, and recycled with <tt>s6dns_engine_recycle()</tt>
after each use. It contains a stralloc, so it must be freed with
<tt>s6dns_engine_free()</tt> before being discarded, to avoid memory leaks.
</p>

<h2> Functions </h2>

<h3> <tt>s6dns_engine_t</tt> life cycle </h3>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_engine_init (s6dns_engine_t *dt, s6dns_ip46list_t const *servers, uint32_t options, char const *q, unsigned int qlen, uint16_t qtype, tain_t const *deadline, tain_t const *stamp) </code>
</p>

<p>
Initializes <em>dt</em> with query <em>q</em> of length <em>qlen</em>
and type <em>qtype</em>. If <tt>d</tt> is an
encoded <tt>s6dns_domain_t</tt>, then <tt>d.s</tt> and <tt>d.len</tt>
are appropriate candidates for arguments <em>q</em> and <em>qlen</em>
respectively.
</p>

<p>
<em>options</em> can be 0 or an OR'ed
combination of the following, defined in <tt>s6-dns/s6dns-constants.h</tt>:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> S6DNS_O_RECURSIVE: the query will be recursive and assuming it is
sent to a DNS cache, instead of iterative and assuming it is sent to a
DNS server. </li>
 <li> S6DNS_O_STRICT: the library will only accept authoritative answers
to iterative queries. This is normally the sane behaviour, but badly
configured DNS software around the world - notably, <a href="../bind.html">
BIND</a> when it's configured to be both a cache and a server - often
serve <em>non-</em>authoritative data even when they could, so it
breaks things, hence why the option isn't set by default. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>servers</em> must point to a list of IP addresses as defined in
<a href="s6dns-ip46.html">s6-dns/s6dns-ip46.h</a>. Such a list can be
obtained from the <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> file via the
<a href="s6dns-rci.html">s6dns_rci_fill()</a> call when performing a
recursive query, or it must be constructed from a list of relevant
NS addresses when performing an iterative query.
</p>

<p>
<em>stamp</em> must be an accurate enough timestamp. <em>deadline</em>
sets up a deadline for the query: if the query hasn't been
satisfactorily answered by <em>deadline</em> - no matter how many
round-trips to network servers the library performs internally - then
it will be considered failed, and a timeout will be reported.
</p>

<p>
The function returns 1 if all went well, and 0 if an error occurred.
It returns instantly; it <em>does not</em> perform any network operation,
it just prepares <em>dt</em> to send a query. The actual data sending
will take place on the next <tt>s6dns_engine_event()</tt> call.
</p>

<p>
<code> void s6dns_engine_recycle (s6dns_engine_t *dt) </code>
</p>

<p>
Recycles <tt>dt</tt>, making it ready for another use. This function
does not deallocate the heap memory used by dt, so it's faster than
<tt>s6dns_engine_free()</tt> and does not cause heap fragmentation. 
</p>

<p>
<code> void s6dns_engine_free (s6dns_engine_t *dt) </code>
</p>

<p>
Frees the heap memory used by <tt>dt</tt>. Also makes <tt>dt</tt>
ready for another use. It's advised to only use this function when
certain that <em>dt</em> will not be reused.
</p>

<h3> Before the <tt>iopause()</tt> </h3>

<p>
 The descriptor to select on is available as the <tt>fd</tt> field in
the <tt>s6dns_engine_t</tt> structure.
<em>dt</em>&rarr;fd should be read every iteration, because it can
change between iterations even if no event or timeout is reported
for <em>dt</em>.
</p>

<p>
<code> void s6dns_engine_nextdeadline (s6dns_engine_t const *dt, tain_t *a) </code>
</p>

<p>
If <em>dt</em> needs handling before the absolute date *<em>a</em>,
then *<em>a</em> is updated
so it contains the earlier date. This is useful to compute the next
deadline in an <tt>iopause()</tt> loop.
</p>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_engine_isreadable (s6dns_engine_t const *dt) </code>
</p>

<p>
Returns nonzero iff <em>dt</em>&rarr;fd is to be selected for reading.
Should be called in every iteration.
</p>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_engine_iswritable (s6dns_engine_t const *dt) </code>
</p>

<p>
Returns nonzero iff <em>dt</em>&rarr;fd is to be selected for writing.
Should be called in every iteration.
</p>

<h3> After the <tt>iopause()</tt> </h3>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_engine_timeout (s6dns_engine_t *dt, tain_t const *stamp) </code>
</p>

<p>
This function should be called if your selecting function returned 0, which
means that an event timed out.
<em>stamp</em> should contain the current time. The function returns -1 if
an error occurred, 1 if <em>dt</em> actually timed out, and 0 if nothing
special happened to <em>dt</em> (and your iopause timeout was caused by
something else). If the return value is not 0, <em>dt</em> is automatically
recycled.
</p>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_engine_event (s6dns_engine_t *dt, tain_t const *stamp) </code>
</p>

<p>
This function should be called if your selecting function returned a positive
number, which means that some event got triggered.
<em>stamp</em> should contain the current time. The function returns
-1 if an error occurred (and <em>dt</em> is automatically recycled). It
returns 0 if no answer has arrived yet, and 1 if an answer is available.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>s6dns_engine_timeout()</tt> and <tt>s6dns_engine_event()</tt> functions,
when returning -1, make use of the following error codes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li> EINVAL: Invalid <em>dt</em>.
 <li> ENETUNREACH: All the servers in the <em>servers</em> list have been
unsuccessfully tried. </li>
 <li> EPROTO: An answer arrived, but it didn't follow the DNS protocol. </li>
 <li> Other error codes reporting socket or system failures. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<code> char *s6dns_engine_packet (s6dns_engine_t const *dt) </code>
</p>

<p>
Points to the response packet received from the network,
if <tt>s6dns_engine_event()</tt> returned 1.
</p>

<p>
<code> unsigned int s6dns_engine_packetlen (s6dns_engine_t const *dt) </code>
</p>

<p>
Gives the length of the response packet,
if <tt>s6dns_engine_event()</tt> returned 1.
</p>

<p>
 You should recycle or free <em>dt</em> after reading the response packet.
</p>

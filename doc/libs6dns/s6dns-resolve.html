<h1> The <tt>s6dns_resolve</tt> library interface </h1>

<p>
 The following functions are declared in the <tt>s6-dns/s6dns-resolve.h</tt> header,
and implemented in the <tt>libs6dns.a</tt> or <tt>libs6dns.so</tt> library.
</p>

<h2> General information </h2>

<p>
 <tt>s6dns_resolve</tt> provides functions and macros - mostly macros -
to perform high level synchronous DNS resolution.
</p>

<p>
 All the functions declared here make synchronous calls to the network, so
they can block for a non-negligible amount of time. To avoid unbounded
waiting times, they always take 2 arguments at the end, <em>deadline</em>
and <em>stamp</em>. <em>deadline</em> is the read-only address of a
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/skalibs/libstddjb/tai.html">tain_t</a>
containing an absolute time which is the deadline for the function, and
<em>stamp</em> is the read-write address of a <tt>tain_t</tt> being
an accurate enough representation of the current absolute time. If
the function has not returned by *<em>deadline</em>, then it immediately
returns with a failure code and errno set to ETIMEDOUT. In every case,
*<em>stamp</em> is automatically updated so it always represents the
absolute time accurately enough.
</p>

<p>
 In a single-threaded program, the STAMP global variable can be used to
store the current time. Macros ending with <tt>_g</tt> use this variable
automatically so you don't have to provide the <em>stamp</em> argument
everytime. Additionally, several resolution functions make implicit use
of global variables such as:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>s6dns_engine_here</tt>: a global
<a href="s6dns-engine.html">s6dns_engine_t</a> storing the current
query, for sequential queries. </li>
 <li> <tt>s6dns_debughook_zero</tt>: a global <tt>s6dns_debughook_t</tt>
meaning no debugging is needed. </li>
 <li> <tt>s6dns_rci_here</tt>: a global
<a href="s6dns-rci.html">s6dns_rci_t</a> containing the current
resolv.conf information. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Reentrant, non-global-using functions are also provided, with the <tt>_r</tt>
suffix. In other words, if <em>foobarfunc</em> is a resolution function,
the following prototypes are generally provided, from the simplest to the
most complex:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <em>foobarfunc_g</em>: only the relevant parameters and a deadline
must be given, the function uses the STAMP global and maybe DNS-specific
globals </li>
 <li> <em>foobarfunc</em>: a deadline and stamp must be given, the function
uses all the DNS-specific globals </li>
 <li> <em>foobarfunc_r_g</em>: No DNS-specific globals are used, the
information must be given via parameters, but the STAMP global is used </li>
 <li> <em>foobarfunc_r</em>: fully reentrant function using no globals
at all </li>
</ul>

<p>
 For each set of four functions, only one is documented here.
The other prototypes can be found in the <tt>s6-dns/s6dns-resolve.h</tt> file.
</p>

<p>
 Some <tt>errno</tt> codes reported by these functions do not have
exactly the system meaning given by
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/strerror.html">strerror()</a>.
To get a user-friendly error message, use
<tt>s6dns_constants_error_str(errno)</tt> instead. The <tt>s6dns_constants_error_str</tt>
function is declared in the <tt>s6dns-constants.h</tt> header.
</p>

<h2> Functions </h2>

<h3> Single query resolution </h3>

<p>
 These functions are ordered from the lowest level to the highest level.
</p>

<h4> Basic wrapper around s6dns_engine </h4>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_resolve_loop_r_g (s6dns_engine_t *dt, tain_t const *deadline) </code> <br />
Resolves the query stored in <tt>dt</tt>.
Returns 1 on success or 0 on failure.
</p>

<h4> Generic resolution functions </h4>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_resolve_core_g (s6dns_domain_t const *d, uint16_t qtype, tain_t const *deadline) </code> <br />
Resolves the query on domain *<em>d</em> (in packet form), of type <em>qtype</em>.
Returns 0 on failure, or 1 on success, in which case
<tt>s6dns_engine_here</tt> contains the answer.
</p>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_resolve_parse_g (s6dns_domain_t const *d, uint16_t qtype, s6dns_message_rr_func_t *f, void *data, tain_t const *deadline) </code> <br />
Resolves the query on domain *<em>d</em> (in packet form), of type <em>qtype</em>,
then parses the answer with function <em>f</em> and stores the result into <em>data</em>.
Returns 1 if it succeeds, 0 if no data can be extracted from the answer, or -1 if an
error occurs. Sets errno in the last two cases.
</p>

<p>
 Note that the function can return 1 without appending anything to <em>data</em>.
This means that the servers confirmed that the domain exists, but <em>f</em>
has not been able to find any data relevant to the query in the answer.
This is very different from NXDOMAIN, which means that
the servers deny the actual existence of the domain, and which is reported
here as a return code of 0 with errno set to ENOENT.
</p>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_resolvenoq_g (char const *name, size_t len, uint16_t qtype, s6dns_message_rr_func_t *f, void *data, tain_t const *deadline) </code> <br />
Performs a query of type <em>qtype</em> on name <em>name</em> of length <em>len</em>,
without qualifying it. Parses the answer with function <em>f</em> and stores the
result into <em>data</em>. Returns 1 if it succeeds, 0 if no data can be extracted,
or -1 if an error occurs. Sets errno in the last two cases.
</p>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_resolveq_g (char const *name, size_t len, uint16_t qtype, s6dns_message_rr_func_t *f, void *data, tain_t const *deadline) </code> <br />
Performs a query of type <em>qtype</em> on name <em>name</em> of length <em>len</em>,
qualifying it first. Parses the answer with function <em>f</em> and stores the
result into <em>data</em>. Returns 1 if it succeeds, 0 if none of the FQDNs can
get a positive answer, or -1 if an error occurs. Sets errno in the last two cases.
</p>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_resolve_g (char const *name, size_t len, uint16_t qtype, s6dns_message_rr_func_t *f, void *data, int qualif, tain_t const *deadline) </code> <br />
Performs a query of type <em>qtype</em> on name <em>name</em> of length <em>len</em>.
Qualifies <em>name</em> first if <em>qualif</em> is nonzero; else, does not
qualify it. Parses the answer with function <em>f</em> and stores the
result into <em>data</em>. Returns 1 if it succeeds, 0 if none of the FQDNs can
get a positive answer, or -1 if an error occurs. Sets errno in the last two cases.
</p>

The number of appended integers is the total number of answers. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Parallel resolution </h4>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_resolven_loop_g (s6dns_engine_t *dtl, unsigned int n,
unsigned int or, tain_t const *deadline) </code> <br />
 Resolves the <em>n</em> queries stored in the array pointed to by <em>dtl</em>,
in parallel. If <em>or</em> is zero, it does not return before all answers
have arrived. If <em>or</em> is 1, it returns when an answer arrives, but does
not return if a query generates an error (unless all queries do so). If
<em>or</em> is 2, it returns when an answer arrives or an error occurs.
Other values of <em>or</em> are unspecified yet.

<p>
 The return code is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> If <em>or</em> is 0: -1 on a global error (i.e. not specific to
a query), or a non-negative number which is the total of successful
queries. </li>
 <li> If <em>or</em> is 1 or 2: -1 on a global error, or a non-negative
number which is the index of the query that triggered the event. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 If <em>or</em> is 1, a return code of -1 with errno set to ENOENT
means that all the queries failed.
</p>

<p>
 After the function returns, the <tt>status</tt> field of each
<tt>s6dns_engine_t</tt> contains the error code relative to the query.
A status of 0 means that an answer has properly arrived; EAGAIN means
that the query is still pending (and the s6dns_engine_t has not been
recycled); ECONNABORTED means that the query has not been properly
initialized. Other codes report various network problems.
</p>

<p>
<code> int s6dns_resolven_parse_g (s6dns_resolve_t const *list, unsigned int n,
tain_t const *deadline) </code> <br />
Performs <em>n</em> complete resolutions in parallel, parsing the results.
Returns 1 in case of success or 0 if a global error occurred.
</p>

<p>
<em>list</em> is a pointer to an array of <em>n</em> <tt>s6dns_resolve_t</tt>,
which is a structure containing at least the following fields:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>q</tt>&nbsp;: a <tt>s6dns_domain_t</tt> containing the query.
It must be in encoded form. </li>
 <li> <tt>qtype</tt>&nbsp;: a <tt>uint16</tt> containing the query type.
A list of valid query types can be found in the <tt>s6dns-constants.h</tt>
header. </li>
 <li> <tt>options</tt>&nbsp;: a <tt>uint32</tt> containing options passed
to <a href="s6dns-engine.html">s6dns_engine_init()</a>. </li>
 <li> <tt>deadline</tt>&nbsp;: a <tt>tain_t</tt> containing the
deadline for this query, i.e. the query will fail with an ETIMEDOUT code
if no answer has arrived by then. Note that the <em>deadline</em>
argument given to s6dns_resolven_parse() is a global deadline that
can make the function return with 0 ETIMEDOUT, but is independent from
this field, which is local to every query. </li>
 <li> <tt>parsefunc</tt>&nbsp;: a <tt>s6dns_message_rr_func_t</tt>
function that will be used to parse the answer. </li>
 <li> <tt>data</tt>&nbsp;: a <tt>void *</tt> that will be passed as an
additional pointer to the <tt>parsefunc</tt> function; it is generally
used to store the parsing result. </li>
 <li> <tt>status</tt>&nbsp;: an <tt>int</tt>. It does not need to be
initialized. It will contain the error code for the query after the
function returns. ECONNABORTED means that the query could not be
started at all; EAGAIN means that the query was still pending when
an error happened; other codes report various network problems. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 The s6dns_resolven_parse() function is a simple, convenient way to
perform several resolutions in parallel to avoid the waiting time
incurred by serial resolutions. However, it is still a synchronous
function, and cannot replace a real asynchronous DNS library: for
more complex parallel resolution needs, use the
<a href="../skadns/">skadns</a> library.
